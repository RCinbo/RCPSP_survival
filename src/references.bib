abstract = {The resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) is one of the most studied problems in the project scheduling literature, and aims at constructing a project schedule with a minimum makespan that satisfies both the precedence relations of the network and the limited availability of the renewable resources. The problem has attracted attention due to its NP hardness status, and different algorithms have been proposed that solve a wide variety of RCPSP instances to optimality or near-optimality. In this paper, we analyse the hardness of this problem from an experimental point-of-view by testing different algorithms on a huge set of existing instances and detect which ones are difficult to solve. To that purpose, we propose a three-phased approach that makes use of five elementary blocks, well-performing algorithms and a huge amount of computational power to transform easy RCPSP instances into very hard ones. The purpose of this study is to create insight and understanding into what makes an RCPSP instance hard, and propose a new dataset that consists of a small set of instances that are impossible to solve with the algorithms currently existing in the literature. These instances should be as small as possible in terms of number of activities and resources, and should be as diverse as possible in terms of network structure and resource strictness. Such a dataset should enable researchers to focus their attention on the development of radically new algorithms to solve the RCPSP rather than gradually improving current algorithms that can solve the existing RCPSP instances only slightly better.}

abstract = {A large number of optimal and suboptimal procedures have been developed for solving combinatorial problems modeled as activity networks. The need to differentiate between easy and hard problem instances and the interest in isolating the fundamental factors that determine the computing effort required by these procedures, inspired a number of researchers to develop various complexity measures. In this paper we investigate the relation between the hardness of a problem instance and the topological structure of its underlying network, as measured by the complexity index. We demonstrate through a series of experiments that the complexity index, defined as the minimum number of node reductions necessary to transform a general activity network to a series-parallel network, plays an important role in predicting the computing effort needed to solve easy and hard instances of the multiple resource-constrained project scheduling problem and the discrete time/cost trade-off problem.}

abstract = {The measurement of the ‘complexity’ of activity networks seems to be needed in order to estimate the computing requirements and/or to validly compare alternative heuristic procedures. This paper critically evaluates past contributions to the problem, and explores the underlying concepts of measurement. It suggests that the objective of analysis of the network is a determining factor in the process of measurement, and discusses three different objectives; they are: to determine the critical path assuming deterministic time estimates; to determine the probability distribution function of project completion assuming random durations of the activities; and to determine the optimal schedule under limited availability of a single resource. It proposes the form of the measure of network complexity for each objective, and explicitly exhibits the form of the measure relative to the first objective based on a sample of 104 networks.}
